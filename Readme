# Crop Recommendation System with Weather Integration

A machine learning-powered tool that recommends the **best crop to grow** based on soil nutrients and real-time weather data.

---

##  Project Overview

This project combines:
- A **RandomForestClassifier** trained on the [Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) (available in this repo as `Crop_recommendation.csv`).
- Live weather data from the **Open-Meteo API**.

Users can:
- Enter input manually or fetch weather based on location (latitude & longitude).
- Receive suggestions for **crop**, **fertilizer**, and **cultivation tips**.
- View soil nutrient visualizations including NPK bar charts and a pH level indicator.

---

##  Usage Instructions

1. Launch the notebook `Untitled8.ipynb` in your preferred environment (e.g., Google Colab or JupyterLab).

2. Ensure `Crop_recommendation.csv` is available in the working directory.

3. **Run the notebook**. You will be prompted to choose the input mode:
   - **Manual mode**: Enter soil (N, P, K, pH) and weather (temperature, humidity, rainfall) values manually.
   - **Location mode**: Provide latitude & longitude, and the app will fetch temperature, humidity, and rainfall from the Open-Meteo API. Soil parameters must still be entered manually.

4. The notebook will:
   - Train a Random Forest model (accuracy is logged).
   - Make a prediction for the recommended crop.
   - Suggest a balanced fertilizer amount.
   - Display a helpful cultivation **tip** tailored to the predicted crop.
   - Generate visualizations: NPK comparison vs. average, and a soil pH gauge.

##  Example Output
Model trained. Accuracy: 0.98
Choose mode: manual or location? location
Enter latitude: 9.3986
Enter longitude: 76.4902
Nitrogen (kg/ha): 90
Phosphorus (kg/ha): 42
Potassium (kg/ha): 43
Soil pH (0â€“14): 6.5
â˜€ Weather â€” Temp: 25.6 Â°C, Humidity: 94%, Rainfall: 200 mm

--- Prediction ---
Recommended Crop: Rice ðŸŒ¾
Fertilizer Suggestion: 58.33 kg/acre (balanced NPK)
Tip: Maintain 5â€“7 cm standing water during growth. Apply nitrogen in 3 split doses.

- **Weather API**: Open-Meteo provides current conditions including hourly data.
- **Libraries Used**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `requests`, `matplotlib`.

##  Future Enhancements

- Add **season-aware logic** to filter crops based on current month or growing season.
- Integrate **additional environmental data** (e.g., soil moisture, day length).
- Build a **web or mobile interface** for easier access.
